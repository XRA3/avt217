    <p> Step 1: Open Adobe XD </p>
    <p> Step 2: Make a new file with a width of 1920 and height of 1080</p>
    <p> Step 3: Click on the rectangle and make the width 484, and make height 292</p>
    <p> Step 4: Center the rectangle: on transform put 749 in X and 336 for Y.</p>
    <p> Step 5: Fill the rectangle with HEX #4E9CA8</p>
    <p> Step 6: Click on the line tool. Put the line tool at the very left top of the rectangle and drag it to the center of the shape.</p>

    <p> Step 8: Change the size of the line's border to 4.</p>
    <p> Step 9: Copy and paste the line you have.</p>
    <p> Step 10: With the new pasted line, try mirroring it with the other line you have that is in the rectangle. Note: Transform 960.5 X, 345.5 Y</p>
    <p> Step 11: Click on the circle shape. While holding shift, make a circle and put it center of your rectangle and where the two lines intersect. The circle shouldn't be too big or small, make it 60 W, 60H.</p>
    <p> Step 12: Make the circle's color be HEX #FF0000</p>
    <p> Step 13: The drawing is finished. Now you should save it.</p>
